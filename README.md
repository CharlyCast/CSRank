# PageRank
Two different algorithms that estimate the PageRanks of the pages on a website. 
The first algorithm performs random walks on the web to explore the web and estimate the pageranks at the same time.
The second algorithm first explores the web using breadth-first search, and then performs random walks locally to estimate the PageRanks.


The libraries gs-core-1.3.jar, gs-ui-1.3.jar and jsoup-1.8.1.jar have to be added to the java build path.
